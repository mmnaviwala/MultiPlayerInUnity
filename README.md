Multiplayer Car Racing Game in Unity
====================================

This is my attemp to create a multiplayer game in Unity3D. Most of the car assets were taken from the [Sample Assets](http://u3d.as/content/unity-technologies/sample-assets-beta-for-unity-4-6/90A) provided by Unity, and I used [Photon Unity Networking](http://doc.exitgames.com/en/pun/current/getting-started/pun-intro) for multiplayer networking.
